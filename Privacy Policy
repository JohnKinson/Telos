**Effective date:** February 3, 2026  
**Last updated:** February 3, 2026

Telos (“we”, “our”, “us”) provides a personal wellbeing dashboard application. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices.

## 1) Information We Collect

We may collect:

1. **Account and connection data**
   - OAuth connection metadata (for example, Oura authorization status)
   - Encrypted tokens required to sync connected services

2. **Health and activity data (if you connect Oura)**
   - Sleep, readiness, activity, heart-rate-related metrics, and related daily summaries

3. **Technical logs**
   - Service logs for security, reliability, and debugging (without storing raw OAuth secrets in logs)

## 2) How We Use Information

We use data to:

- Sync and display your dashboard
- Compute daily features, scores, and drivers/explanations
- Generate suggestions and trends
- Maintain security, prevent abuse, and operate the service

## 3) Legal Basis / Consent

Where required, we process your data based on your consent and/or legitimate interest in providing the service you requested.

## 4) Sharing

We do **not** sell your personal data.  
We only share data with service providers needed to run the app (for example, hosting/database infrastructure), under confidentiality and security obligations.

## 5) Data Retention

We retain data while your account is active or as needed to provide the service.  
You can request deletion at any time by contacting: johhnkinson@outlook.com.

## 6) Security

We use reasonable safeguards including encryption at rest for connector tokens and access controls. No system can be guaranteed 100% secure.

## 7) Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, export, or delete your data.  
Contact us at johhnkinson@outlook.com.

## 8) Third-Party Services

If you connect third-party providers (e.g., Oura), their terms and privacy policies also apply to data they process.

## 9) Children

Telos is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction).

## 10) Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy periodically. We will post updates at this URL with a new “Last updated” date.
